20220211 UPDATE:
1) merged ITS which is regenerated ITSs with TCGA recompute TPM matrix 
    (rawcounts -> genelength corrected TPM), path:
    /picb/bigdata/project/FengFYM/p2_1_immunotherapy_targetedtherapy/r1_drug_immuneSig_correlation_analysis/03_drug_immuneSig_enrichment/data/ITS_mclust_Otsuka_Ochiai_TUMERIC_spearman_r_0.4_ITSproof_2_genevote_0.5

2) run 70138 and 92742 with merged ITSs
3) if tumor purity generated from TUMERIC method is not available, 
    use CPE as tumor purity generating method, i.e. SKCM Primary
